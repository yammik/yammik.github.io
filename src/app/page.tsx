          <h3>May the developer</h3>
          <p>
            I am a full stack engineer at Parsec at Unity. I write frontend and
            backend code, and maintain cloud services infrastructure.

          <h3>May the person</h3>
          <p>
            When I started having more fun making browser widgets and laboratory
            gadgets than doing actual research in my microbiology PhD program, I
            decided software engineering was a good path forward for me. I
            finished a coding bootcamp called Flatiron in NYC and became one of
            the early members of Parsec. I've contributed to taking the team
            from a small startup to acquisition by Unity.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve contributed to all stack at Parsec, as well as building out
            internal metrics tools that others can use to improve their
            workflow. I enjoy working on the whole process of building an app,
            front to back. While I enjoy being a generalist, my involvement in a
            diverse range of projects led me to value having domain knowledge
            expertise as well as the ability to collaborate effectively in
            cross-functional teams.
